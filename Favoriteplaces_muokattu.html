<h2>Favorite places</h2>
<p>There are numerous lovely places all over the world. Some of my favorite places can be found in Finland, for example in Kuopio. When people think about Finland, usually they have forests and lakes in mind. Both are a big part of Finnish landscape.</p>
  <p>About 75% of Finland is covered by forests.</p>
