<h2>Favorite places</h2>
<p>There are numerous lovely places all over the world. Some of my favorite places can be found in Finland, for example in Kuopio. When people think about Finland, usually they have forests and lakes in mind. Both are a big part of Finnish landscape.</p>
  <p>About 75% of Finland is covered by forests.</p>

    <h2>Kuopio's beautiful nature</h2>
    <p>Kuopio is surrounded by the Lake Kallavesi, which is the tenth largest lake in Finland. In addition to the lake, the residents can enjoy many nature trails. Perhaps the most famous place in Kuopio is Puijo Nature Activity Park. Besides enjoying the nature trails, people can also do winter and extreme sports in the park. Other great places for hiking and excercising in Kuopio are for example Neulam√§ki, Saaristokaupunki and Rauhalahti.</p>
